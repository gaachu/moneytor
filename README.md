# moneytor
This app defines three classes: Transaction, Account, and Budget. A Transaction represents a single financial transaction, with a date, an amount, and a category. An Account represents a bank account or other financial account, with a name, a balance, and a list of transactions. An Account can be used to deposit or withdraw money, and provides methods to get the account balance and list of transactions. A Budget represents a budget for a specific category of expenses, with a name, an amount, a list of transactions, and a method to add a transaction to the budget.

The MONEYTOR class is the main interface for the app. It provides methods to add accounts and budgets, and to get the balance and transactions for a specific account or budget.

Note that this code is just an example and does not include all the functionality that a real money tracker app might have. Additionally, storing financial data in memory like this may not be secure or scalable, so it is important to consider security and data storage options when building a real app.
